# Base Builder Rewards Boost

This repository is dedicated to boosting Base Builder Rewards activity through meaningful contributions to the Base ecosystem.

## Purpose

The Base Builder Rewards program recognizes developers who contribute to the Base ecosystem through:

- Verified contributions to public crypto repositories
- Activity on verified contracts deployed on Base
- Building innovative solutions on Base

## Features

- Smart contract development tools
- Base ecosystem utilities
- DeFi protocol integrations
- NFT marketplace components
- Cross-chain bridge implementations
- Automated testing frameworks
- Gas optimization libraries
- Developer documentation

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Smart Contracts

### RewardMultipliers.sol
A comprehensive smart contract that manages reward multipliers for different types of contributions:

- **GitHub Activity Multiplier**: 1.5x for verified commits
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: 2.0x for verified contracts on Base
- **DeFi Protocol Integration**: 2.5x for protocol contributions
- **Cross-chain Bridge Usage**: 3.0x for bridge implementations
- **Community Engagement**: 1.2x for documentation and tutorials

### BaseRewards.test.js
Comprehensive test suite covering:

- Reward calculation accuracy
- Multiplier application logic
- Edge cases and error handling
- Gas optimization verification
- Security vulnerability testing

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Reward Calculator**: Processes contribution scores and applies multipliers
2. **Verification System**: Validates GitHub commits and contract deployments
3. **Distribution Engine**: Handles reward token distribution
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks progress and performance metrics

### Integration Points

- **GitHub API**: For commit verification and activity tracking
- **Base Network**: For contract deployment verification
- **Talent Protocol**: For builder score integration
- **Farcaster**: For social engagement metrics
